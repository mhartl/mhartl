# Michael Hartlâ€™s GitHub Profile

Welcome to my public profile! This includes an example of a [Certificate of Completion](https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/mhartl) from [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/). It works like this:

[![Learn Enough Course Completed](https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/mhartl/command-line-tutorial.svg)](https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/mhartl)
